## 2026-05-23 — Sub-phase 2.0 ready for review

- Cache module gained a `ttl.rs` helper layer with read-through / put / invalidate APIs. Diff and threads bundle into single rows keyed by a deterministic synthetic pr_id derived from (owner, repo, number) — sidesteps a race where `openPr` fetches PR + diff + threads concurrently.
- Drafts table extended in-place with `start_line` / `start_side` columns (ALTER TABLE with column-presence probe; old DBs upgrade silently).
- Monaco view zones: gutter `+` glyph, click → inline editor view zone; drag-select → floating "Comentar N linhas" button; existing threads + saved drafts render inline. Each zone owns its own React root via `createRoot`; tracked in a Map and unmounted on a deferred microtask to dodge React's commit-phase unmount warning.
- ThreadsSidebar is no longer rendered in DiffPanel but the file is kept until sub-phase 2.4 removes it (along with `CommentLineModal`).
- AppImage workaround: `NO_STRIP=true pnpm tauri build --bundles appimage` — linuxdeploy's bundled `strip` can't read the `SHT_RELR` section in modern host libs. Documented in `docs/appimage-bundle.md`. AppImage at ~105 MB.

## 2026-05-23 — 2.0 approved

Approved after a long bug-fix tail during manual smoke. Notable findings worth carrying forward:

- React.StrictMode disabled in `src/main.tsx`: incompatible with `@monaco-editor/react`'s DiffEditor lifecycle (double-mount disposes the model out of order). Don't reintroduce without a different editor adapter.
- `keyring` crate v3 requires `features = ["sync-secret-service"]` on Linux; default backend is `MockCredential` (in-memory) which silently fails to persist the PAT. Documented in `Cargo.toml`.
- Monaco view zones for interactive React widgets needed: `position: relative; zIndex: 1; pointerEvents: auto` on the zone root + `onMouseDownCapture/onMouseUpCapture stopPropagation` for the focus-theft fix + bubble-phase `onClick` (capture-phase stops the click before reaching child buttons) + `keepCurrentOriginalModel`/`keepCurrentModifiedModel` + unique `originalModelPath`/`modifiedModelPath` per (PR, file) + cleanup that snapshots `mounted` entries before the deferred unmount microtask.
- Editor lines vs file lines: parsing must build both `modifiedLineMap` (editor→file) and `modifiedFileToEditor` (file→editor); commentable set excludes hunk separators AND context lines (user model is "only what I modified"); gutter shows file lines via `updateOptions({ lineNumbers })`.
- GitHub `ReviewEvent` enum: use `#[serde(rename_all = "SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE")]` — `UPPERCASE` produces `REQUESTCHANGES` without the underscore.
- GitHub error extraction: read `Error::GitHub { source }` and surface `source.message + source.errors` — `e.to_string()` collapses everything to "GitHub".
- Threads cache (and PR cache + diff cache) MUST be invalidated after `submit_review` / `reply_to_thread`. Otherwise the user's just-submitted review is invisible until the 5 min TTL.
- `openPr` always force-refreshes (`api.refreshPr`) — covers the case where the PR changed on GitHub between sessions (deleted reviews, new commits). Cache still serves intra-PR file navigation.
- AppImage workaround: `NO_STRIP=true pnpm tauri build --bundles appimage` (linuxdeploy bundled `strip` can't read modern `SHT_RELR` sections). Documented in `docs/appimage-bundle.md`.

Architectural audit: `docs/superpowers/notes/2026-05-23-diff-audit.md` — wrote it mid-2.0 after the bug-whack-a-mole grew tiring; the audit's fix-order matches what shipped. Useful read for future Monaco-adjacent work.

## 2026-05-23 — Sub-phase 2.1 ready for review

- `src/styles/tokens.css` added with spacing / type / radius / shadow / motion / z-index / control-height scales. `globals.css` `@import`s tokens and keeps legacy aliases (`--pad`, `--gap`, `--radius`) so any unrefactored consumer keeps working.
- `src/components/ui/` houses the primitive library: `Button` (variants × sizes + icon), `Input`, `Textarea`, `Dropdown`, `Modal` (with Esc-to-close), `Tabs`, `Tooltip`, `Badge`, `Avatar` (GitHub-derived URL with initial fallback), `Spinner`, `EmptyState`. Re-exported via `ui/index.ts`.
- Hover / focus-visible states live in `globals.css` via classes `prr-btn`, `prr-input`, `prr-row` (selectable list rows). `--shadow-focus` doubles as the focus ring.
- `common/Modal.tsx` deleted — only two import sites (`SettingsModal`, `ReviewSubmitModal`) were updated to consume `ui/Modal`. Banner + ToastStack moved to token-driven spacing while staying in `common/`.
- Refactor pass touched: settings (Pat, Repos, Filters, SettingsModal), PR list (panel + item, EmptyState for the empty case), file tree (node + panel + group header), diff inline widgets (Editor, Draft, Thread — Thread now shows Avatars per comment), PanelHeader, App shell (FAB + gear).
- Hidden gallery route: open the app with `#/__ui` to render `UiGallery.tsx` — every primitive in one page. Useful for smoke before approval.
- `pnpm tsc --noEmit`, `pnpm test`, `cargo test`, and `pnpm exec vite build` all clean.

## 2026-05-23 — Sub-phase 2.2 ready for review

- `PrSummary` extended with `changed_files: i64` and `ci_status: CiStatus` (passing/pending/failing/none). Search list endpoint doesn't expose either, so `list_prs` fans out per-PR concurrent fetches via `tokio::task::JoinSet`: one `/repos/{o}/{r}/pulls/{n}` (changed_files + head sha) and one `/commits/{sha}/status` (combined state). Errors are swallowed — affected rows fall back to defaults. List-cache TTL (60 s) absorbs the extra latency on warm fetches.
- `get_pr` augments its `summary` with the same fields using the same helpers — keeps PR-detail consumers consistent.
- Frontend: persistent search input at top of PR list panel (`Ctrl+P` focuses + selects), tab labels show counts (`Pra revisar (N)` / `Meus (N)`), repo group header shows repo name only with `owner/repo` tooltip on hover, PR title truncates to one line with ellipsis + tooltip, meta line is `author · age · N changed`, CI dot at left of each row. `formatAge` util added (`src/util/time.ts`) returning `30s` / `10m` / `2h` / `3d` / `2w` / `3mo` / `2y`.
- Empty states branched: no repos, no PRs (inbox vazio), tab empty, and search-no-match — all via the `EmptyState` primitive.
- Tests: new `formatAge.test.ts`, expanded `PrListPanel.test.tsx` to cover search filter, Ctrl+P focus, tab counts, and empty-search state. Existing fixtures updated to include the new `PrSummary` fields.
- `pnpm tsc --noEmit`, `pnpm test`, `cargo test`, and `pnpm exec vite build` all clean.

## 2026-05-23 — Sub-phase 2.3 ready for review

- `PrDetail` gained `additions`, `deletions`, `reviewers_count` (parsed from `/pulls/{n}` — `requested_reviewers` array length). Frontend types + 3 test fixtures updated.
- `GlobalHeader` replaces the bare gear bar. No PR open → "Pull Requests" title + gear. PR open → breadcrumb `owner/repo › #N title` + back arrow (only when PR list is collapsed) + file-tree toggle + `Revisar (N)` primary button + gear. FAB removed; Revisar lives in the header now.
- PR list autocollapse: `openPr` success sets `uiStore.prListCollapsed = true`; Layout's PR Panel reacts imperatively (`.collapse()/.expand()`) via the panel ref. `onResize` keeps the flag in sync when the user drags the separator.
- File tree stays as a resizable Panel column (not an overlay drawer — user pushed back on the drawer design from the original 2.3 plan). Visible by default when a PR is open. `Ctrl+2` collapses/expands. Collapse icon (`PanelLeftClose`) lives in the file tree panel header; the `Files` button in the global header re-expands when collapsed.
- `PrMetaStrip` under the header: `author · age · N files · +X −Y · CI dot+label · N reviewer(s)` with a Draft badge when `pr.draft`. PR body is a collapsible block below the meta line (plaintext for now; `<pre>` with `pre-wrap` + 240 px scroll cap).
- Shortcuts refactor: `useGlobalShortcuts` now in App (was in Layout). Ctrl/Cmd+1 toggles PR list via uiStore; Ctrl/Cmd+2 toggles file tree drawer. `PanelHeader` deleted — no longer used.
- New tests: `GlobalHeader.test.tsx`, `PrMetaStrip.test.tsx` (breadcrumb assertions, draft count in Revisar label, reviewer singular/plural, body toggle). Existing PrDetail fixtures updated to include the new fields.
- `pnpm tsc --noEmit`, `pnpm test` (21/21), `cargo test` (14/14), `pnpm exec vite build` all clean.

## 2026-05-23 — 2.3 approved

Approved after several layout-feel tweaks during smoke:

- **Overlay drawer → resizable Panel.** The original 2.3 plan had the file tree as a Ctrl+2 drawer floating over the diff. In practice the user wanted it visible by default once a PR opens, with a regular collapse affordance. Drawer code (`FileTreeDrawer.tsx` + test) was deleted; file tree is back as a 3rd Panel with collapse button in its own header.
- **Back arrow closes the PR.** It used to only re-expand the PR list; the diff editor stayed mounted and could only be dismissed by re-clicking the same PR. Added `prsStore.closePr` (clears currentPr, diff, threads, selectedFile, prError) and wired the back arrow to call it.
- **No PR → no split.** When `currentPr` is null, Layout renders the PR list at 22% with a blank right pane — no file-tree placeholder, no diff placeholder, no inner separator.
- **File tree opens at PR-list width.** Setting `defaultSize={22}` was not enough because the Group re-normalizes after PR list `.collapse()` (PR list goes to 0, the remaining 22+56 grow to fill 100, so the tree visually swelled to ~28%). Fix: after collapsing PR list, imperatively `fileTreeRef.resize(22)` so the tree stays at 22% of the parent group and the diff absorbs the slack.
- **Files toggle removed from GlobalHeader.** Re-open affordance is a 22 px rail flush to the left edge that appears when both side panels are collapsed.

Carry-forward for later sub-phases:
- The Panel API has no `onCollapse`/`onExpand` props (only `onResize`). We sync `uiStore.prListCollapsed` / `fileTreeCollapsed` via `onResize` with a 0.5% threshold. If 2.4+ adds more panels (e.g. drafts slide-in), reuse this pattern rather than reaching for an external state library.
- `useGlobalShortcuts` is the single owner of Ctrl+1 / Ctrl+2. Add new global shortcuts there, not scattered.

## 2026-05-23 — 2.2 approved

- Smoke caught one gap: PRs on repos that only use GitHub Actions (Checks API) showed the gray "no checks" dot because the legacy combined-status endpoint returns `total_count = 0` for them. Fixed with a fallback to `/commits/{sha}/check-runs` that aggregates conclusions (`pending` if any run is non-completed, `failing` if any conclusion is failure-ish, otherwise `passing`).
- Carry-forward: `list_prs` is cached for 60 s and the Refresh button doesn't invalidate the list cache — only the per-PR detail/diff/threads bundle. Re-testing CI-status fixes meant waiting out the TTL. Worth wiring a `force_refresh` path through `refreshLists` → `list_prs` in a later sub-phase (probably 2.6 when settings/repos touch the list invalidation anyway).

## 2026-05-23 — Sub-phase 2.4 ready for review

- **Submit review → slide-in panel.** New `ui/SlidePanel` primitive anchored to the right edge (420 px, max 92 vw, click-backdrop and Esc to close). `ReviewSubmitModal` deleted; `ReviewSubmitPanel` is the new component, same submit semantics. App.tsx + GlobalHeader still toggle it via `onOpenSubmit`.
- **Mark viewed per file.** New SQLite `viewed_files (pr_id, path)` table with PK on the tuple + an index on pr_id. Rust module `viewed` exposes `list`/`mark`; Tauri commands `list_viewed_files` + `mark_viewed`. `prsStore.viewedFiles` is a `Set<string>` populated alongside diff/threads in `openPr`, reset by `closePr`. DiffPanel header shows a pill toggle "Marcar como visto" / "Visto" (green border + check icon when on). Persists across app restarts because it's row-based, not bound to the cache TTL.
- **Diff render mode setting.** `UiPrefs.diff_render_mode` added Rust-side (`#[serde(default)]` for backward compat with older configs missing the key). New `Settings → Diff` section with three pill buttons. `useDiffRenderMode(pref)` hook resolves the pref into `renderSideBySide: boolean`, listening to `window.resize` only while pref is `auto`. Auto threshold = 1100 px (constant exported from the hook). The pre-2.4 DiffPanel never had a render-mode toggle in its header, so nothing to remove from there.
- **Inline thread polish.** `InlineThreadWidget` reply textarea now grows from 2→4 rows on focus or when it has content. Resolve button surfaces in the thread header when `node_id` is present; click → GraphQL `resolveReviewThread` mutation → refresh threads → toast.
- **GraphQL augmentation for threads.** `ReviewThread` gained `node_id: Option<String>` and `resolved: bool`. After the REST `/pulls/{n}/comments` fetch, `get_pr_threads` fires one GraphQL query (`reviewThreads(first:100){id isResolved comments(first:1){nodes{databaseId}}}`) to map each thread's root databaseId → `(node_id, isResolved)`. Resolved threads are dropped server-side from the returned vec. New `resolve_thread` Tauri command + `api.resolveThread` IPC binding. Threads cache invalidated after resolve.
- **CommentLineModal / ThreadsSidebar:** already absent from the tree (2.0 deleted them ahead of schedule). Nothing left to remove for the spec's item 5.
- **Tests:** added `ReviewSubmitPanel.test.tsx` (dialog role + submit roundtrip), `InlineThreadWidgetResolve.test.tsx` (resolve button visibility + IPC payload), `useDiffRenderMode.test.ts` (pref + width matrix), Rust `viewed_test.rs` (roundtrip + idempotent mark + unmark). Updated `InlineThreadWidget.test.tsx` fixtures for the new ReviewThread fields. `pnpm tsc --noEmit`, `pnpm test` (27/27), `cargo test` (15/15), `pnpm exec vite build` all clean.

## 2026-05-23 — Sub-phase 2.5 ready for review

- **Compact linear paths** (`src/components/files/treeBuild.ts`): extracted `buildTree` from `FileTreePanel` into its own module, accepting a `compact: boolean`. When ON, chains of single-dir-child are merged. Separator decision per merge: `.` when parent or child is a Java-root (`com / org / io / net / dev / gov / edu / ai / app`) or already contains `.`; else `/`. When walking into a Java-root segment from a non-Java parent we *break* the chain so paths like `src/main/java/com/esparta/scorehub/api/Foo.java` render as two nodes: `src/main/java` (slash) and `com.esparta.scorehub.api` (dot). DirNode gained `originalName` — the unjoined slash path — exposed as the tooltip in `FileTreeNode.tsx`.
- **Flat mode + search**: `FileTreePanel` now has a Tree | Flat segmented toggle in the panel header (FolderTree / List icons) and a persistent search input below. Both views share the search filter (substring match on full path). Flat view (`buildFlat`) renders `[file] [dir] [+a −d]` rows sorted case-insensitively by name; path-filter groups don't apply in flat mode (intentional — flat is for "give me everything as a list").
- **Settings → Aparência**: new section combining the pre-existing Theme picker and a new `Caminhos compactos` checkbox bound to `settings.ui.compact_paths`. The inline Tema section in `SettingsModal` was removed; the modal order is now Repos / Filtros / Diff / Aparência / Token.
- **UiPrefs**: `compact_paths: bool` added (Rust + TS). Rust default is `true` via `#[serde(default = "default_true")]` so older configs missing the key still get compact mode ON.
- **Tests:** new `treeBuild.test.ts` (compact off keeps per-segment; chain merged with `/` for non-Java; Java-root splits chain and joins package with `.`; sibling stops chain; file stops chain; `buildFlat` sort + dir extraction). Extended `FileTreePanel.test.tsx` to cover search filter and the Tree → Flat toggle (dir column visible, group header gone). `pnpm tsc --noEmit`, `pnpm test` (35/35), `cargo test` (15/15), `pnpm exec vite build` all clean.

## 2026-05-23 — Sub-phase 2.6 ready for review

- **`repo_input::parse`** (`src-tauri/src/repo_input.rs`): pure Rust parser returning `Option<(owner, name)>` for `https://github.com/owner/repo[/...]`, `http://…`, `git@github.com:owner/repo.git`, `owner/repo`, and `owner repo`. Validates char sets (owner: alphanum + `-`, no leading/trailing dash, ≤39 chars; repo: alphanum + `-_.` ≤100 chars) and strips a trailing `.git`. 17 unit tests cover each form + invalid inputs.
- **`validate_repo` Tauri command** (`commands::repos`): parses input → calls `GET /repos/{o}/{r}` → returns `RepoConfig` on success. Errors flow through a new `github::map_status_error` that maps 404/403→`NotFound` and 401→`Auth`; ReposSection translates those into Portuguese ("Repo não acessível com seu PAT", "Formato inválido"). `extract_github_error` lifted out of `github::reviews` into `github::mod` so both flows share it.
- **`list_my_repos` + `set_repos`** (`github::repos` + `commands::repos`): paginated `GET /user/repos?per_page=100&sort=updated&affiliation=owner,collaborator,organization_member`. Client-side filters: `include_orgs` (default true; false drops `owner.type == Organization`), `include_forks`, `include_archived`. `set_repos` is a flat overwrite used by the Browse modal Save (diff is computed client-side; rusqlite + config TOML are happier with a single write).
- **`current_user` Tauri command**: returns the GitHub login held by `AppState.client.user_login`. Conta section uses it to render an Avatar + name strip.
- **Settings two-column shell** (`SettingsModal.tsx`): 720-920 px modal with a left nav (Aparência / Repositórios / Filtros / Diff / Conta / Atalhos) and a content pane. Default section: Aparência. Switching is local component state — no router, no URL hash. Old single-column SettingsModal removed; section components stay as the building blocks.
- **AparenciaSection** picked up a **Densidade** picker (Compacta / Confortável / Espaçosa, default Confortável). The pick is persisted as `UiPrefs.density` (Rust enum, `#[serde(default)]`); App.tsx writes `body.dataset.density = density`. CSS exposes `--density-row-pad-y / -x` from `tokens.css`, overridden per `body[data-density]`; PR list rows + file-tree rows consume them.
- **DiffSection** gained a font family dropdown (8 monospace presets) and a numeric size input (8–32 px clamp). `DiffPanel` reads `settings.ui.diff_font` and forwards to Monaco's `fontFamily` / `fontSize` (falls back to JetBrains Mono / 13 if settings haven't loaded).
- **ReposSection rewrite**: paste field calls `validate_repo` (Enter or click) → on success, only adds via `addRepo` if not already configured. Old `owner` + `name` inputs are gone — paste is the single entry point, paired with a "Procurar meus repos no GitHub" CTA that opens the Browse modal.
- **BrowseReposModal** (`components/settings/BrowseReposModal.tsx`): Modal-based, 720 px. Filter pills toggle the Rust-side filter struct + reset pagination to page 1. Search field is a substring match on `full_name` (client-side). Checkboxes pre-checked for already-configured repos; Save = `api.setRepos([...selected])`. Lazy pagination on scroll (`scrollTop + clientHeight >= scrollHeight - 80`). Pages exhaust when GitHub returns <100 rows.
- **ContaSection**: Avatar + login + helper text + Substituir-token inline form (reuses `api.setPat` + `checkPat`) + Sair (`api.clearPat`). Inline form shows password input, error surface, Save/Cancel.
- **AtalhosSection**: static `<kbd>`-styled rows for Ctrl+1 / Ctrl+2 / Ctrl+P / Esc with a footnote about future shortcuts (Ctrl+K lands in 2.7).
- **Tests:** new `SettingsModal.test.tsx` (sidebar present, section switch, paste success calls `addRepo`, NotFound maps to "Repo não acessível com seu PAT", Conta shows login, Atalhos lists shortcuts), `BrowseReposModal.test.tsx` (pre-checked configured rows + Save diff, filter-pill toggle resets pagination + re-fetches with updated filters). `FileTreePanel.test.tsx` fixture extended with the new `density` + `diff_font` fields.
- **Final matrix:** `pnpm tsc --noEmit`, `pnpm test` (43/43), `cargo test` (32/32), `pnpm exec vite build` all clean.

## 2026-05-23 — 2.6 approved

Single fix during smoke:

- **Dropdown options unreadable.** Native `<option>` elements ignore the parent `<select>`'s inline `background` in most engines and fall back to the OS palette — white-on-white in some Linux theme combos. Fix: set `color-scheme: light` / `color-scheme: dark` on `body[data-theme]`, and add a `.prr-input option { background: var(--c-base); color: var(--c-text); }` rule in `globals.css`. Carry-forward: any future native form control (date picker, color picker) inherits `color-scheme` from the body now — no per-component patching needed.

## 2026-05-23 — Sub-phase 2.7 ready for review

- **Custom titlebar (frameless).** `tauri.conf.json` flips `decorations: false` and adds `minWidth/minHeight`. New `TitleBar.tsx` replaces the old `GlobalHeader` and folds breadcrumb + Revisar + palette shortcut + settings gear + min/max/close window buttons into a 36 px bar. Native-feel drag region via `data-tauri-drag-region` on the titlebar root + breadcrumb span; interactive children opt out with `data-tauri-drag-region="false"`. Window control buttons call into the new `src/util/window.ts` wrapper, which lazy-imports `@tauri-apps/api/window` inside try/catch so vitest/jsdom (where there is no Tauri IPC bridge) renders the bar without crashing. Maximize/restore icon swap reacts to `onResized` so OS-side maximize triggers also stay in sync. The OS smoke matrix is currently Linux/Wayland only (Fedora/Nobara dev env); Windows + macOS are untested — flag if any taskbar/snap behavior surfaces during review.
- **Command palette (Ctrl+K).** `CommandPalette.tsx` with reusable `CommandGroup` + `CommandItem` sub-components. No new dep — custom subsequence fuzzy matcher in `src/util/fuzzy.ts` (`fuzzyScore` + `fuzzyFilter`) that scores by span tightness, earliest first-match, and word-boundary bonuses. Sources: PRs (mine ∪ reviewRequested, dedupe by id), files (current PR diff[].path, only when a PR is open), commands (Refresh, Open Settings, Cycle theme, Submit review). `>` prefix flips command-only mode. ↑↓ navigate, Enter dispatch, hover sets active, Esc + backdrop close. The Ctrl+K shortcut now lives alongside Ctrl+1/2 in `useGlobalShortcuts` (takes an `onOpenPalette` callback). Wired into App.tsx + the new TitleBar (the badge button is also the visual hint that Ctrl+K opens the palette).
- **Empty-state polish.** Swapped the remaining ad-hoc copy for the `<EmptyState>` primitive:
  - `FileTreePanel` "Selecione um PR" + "Nenhum arquivo" (flat view) cases.
  - `DiffPanel` "Selecione um arquivo" placeholder when no file is selected.
  - `ReposSection` empty-list state.
  - `BrowseReposModal` no-results state.
  PrListPanel already used `<EmptyState>` end-to-end (shipped in 2.2).
- **AtalhosSection** picked up the Ctrl+K row and dropped the "future shortcuts" footnote.
- **Tests:** new `TitleBar.test.tsx` (ports the old GlobalHeader assertions and adds window-controls dispatch via `vi.mock("../util/window")` + palette button), `CommandPalette.test.tsx` (dedupe, fuzzy filter, `>` mode, Enter selects file + closes, Esc closes, backdrop closes, `> refresh` surfaces command), `fuzzy.test.ts` (empty query, subsequence match, case insensitivity, ranking). Deleted `GlobalHeader.test.tsx` along with the component.
- **Notes / quirks:**
  - `el?.scrollIntoView?.({ block: "nearest" })` — jsdom lacks the method, so the optional call protects tests without changing browser behavior.
  - Theme cycling in the palette mirrors the existing `useTheme().setChoice` flow used by AparenciaSection (no persistence to backend — pre-existing behavior, out of scope for 2.7).
  - Window controls degrade gracefully in non-Tauri contexts (e.g. the `#/__ui` gallery): `getCurrentWindow()` throws → util catches → buttons become no-ops.
- **Final matrix:** `pnpm tsc --noEmit`, `pnpm test` (61/61), `cargo test` (32/32), `pnpm exec vite build` all clean.

### 2026-05-23 — Follow-ups during smoke

- **Window-control permissions missing.** Tauri v2 `core:default` does NOT include the sensitive `window:*` ops or `event:listen/unlisten`. Capability `default.json` extended with `core:window:allow-minimize / allow-toggle-maximize / allow-close / allow-start-dragging / allow-is-maximized` and `core:event:allow-listen / allow-unlisten`. Without these, `data-tauri-drag-region` is also dead because `startDragging` is gated. Carry-forward: any new sensitive Tauri op needs an explicit allow-* permission added here — `core:default` is the *minimum* surface, not "everything safe".
- **Palette repo scope.** Added a "Repositórios" group listing every configured repo with its current PR count. Picking a repo enters scope mode: input row gets a `[owner/name ×]` chip, placeholder becomes "PRs em owner/name…", PR list narrows to that repo, repo entries themselves disappear. Esc on a scoped palette exits the scope (does not close); Backspace on an empty scoped query does the same. List container gained `role="listbox"` so `getAllByRole("option")` works for tests.
- **Settings → Paleta toggles.** New `UiPrefs.palette_sources { prs, files, repos, commands }` (Rust + TS), each defaulted true via `#[serde(default = "default_true")]` for backward compat. New `PaletteSection` (between Diff and Conta) gives a checkbox per source. CommandPalette consumes the toggles and skips disabled source items. Commands remain reachable via `>` mode even when their toggle is off (explicit escape hatch).
- **Bumped matrix:** `pnpm test` (71/71), `cargo test` (32/32), tsc + vite still clean.
